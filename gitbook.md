## Gitbook Usage

Yo dawg, I heard you like documentation that tells you how to make documentation.
So we wrote a doc to explain how we doc, so you can doc, while you doc.

Anyway...

In this repo we keep all the techniques about BOSH and Cloud Foundry that make
things run smoothly for each of our clients.  

Codex is a guideline for all S&W engineers to learn from when they start,
follow when on a project, and contribute to when on the bench.

### What is Gitbook?

Gitbook on the other hand, is a publishing platform that, once a repository is
configured and conforms to the configuration, the files in the repository can be
rendered through a build pipeline that outputs to a number of destinations.

Destinations like:

- A static website that is searchable and displays a TOC.
- Downloadable PDF, ePub and MOBI formats for eBOOK and computer reading anywhere.

### Rubber Meet Road

We created two accounts.  A GitHub account and a Gitbook account.  Both are in
the Stark & Wayne 1Password vault in Dropbox.

If you’re already signed into Gitbook with another account, sign out.   Then go
to https://www.gitbook.com/ and click on SIGN IN.

Type in the username: `starkandwayne` and put in the password from 1Password.

Sign out of GitHub.  Sign into GitHub with the username: `snw-gitbook` and the
password form 1Password.

To set the “source repo” in Gitbook it was necessary to first make the
`snw-gitbook` user a collaborator.

### Collaborators

When signed in to Gitbook, and you know the username or email address to add
someone, use the collaborator link to add users.
