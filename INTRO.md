## Welcome to Codex

This is Codex.  It's a place for Stark & Wayne engineers to share the best
practices of setting up environments for open source Cloud Foundry using
specific techniques that give users additional value outside the day-to-day
value that simply using BOSH and Cloud Foundry might bring.

First we use a Proto-BOSH system that allows for the availability for each of
your sites to be backed up.

Other benefits go here.

There are guides for each major Infrastructure (AWS, Azure, OpenStack, vSphere),
etc. that are usable for people who are either Stark & Wayne employees, clients
of Stark & Wayne, or interested parties.

Please use the [gitbook discussions][discussions] or [github issues][issues] to give
feedback or questions.
