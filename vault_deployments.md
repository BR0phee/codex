## Vault Best Practices

Our best practice is to have a single vault/safe for all deployment environments.
This may not be possible because of security requirement preconditions.   In these cases 
make the additional vault deployments as high as in the global/site/environment structure.

Do not take shortcuts on the vault paths.   Use the full global/site/environment path structure.
