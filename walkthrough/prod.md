### Production Environment

Deploying the production environment will be much like deploying the `beta` environment above. You will need to deploy a BOSH Director, Cloud Foundry, and any services also deployed in the `beta` site. Hostnames, credentials, network information, and possibly scaling parameters will all be different, but the procedure for deploying them is the same.
